# Rust async in practice tokio::select!, actor pattern & cancel safety

## Notes

### Example 1 - pin and sleep

- `sleep()` in a `select!` block doesn't do what you think, use `Interval` instead.

### Example 2 - unsafe code

- Come up with an example to demonstrate cancel unsafety (unintentionally dropping some
  data stored in the future struct that is lost, to interval, when raced in a loop). It
  should have the following branches in an infinite loop:
  1. `tokio::pin!(sleep(..))`.
  2. shutdown signal handler.
  3. cancel unsafe code.
