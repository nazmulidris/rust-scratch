/// Rust enforces a set of rules that govern how references are used via **lifetimes**.
///
/// Lifetimes are named regions of code that a reference must be valid for.
///
/// - For simple programs, lifetimes coincide with lexical scope.
/// - Those regions may be fairly complex, as they correspond to paths of execution in the
///   program.
/// - There may even be holes in these paths of execution, as it's possible to invalidate
///   a reference as long as it's reinitialized before it's used again.
/// - Types which contain references (or pretend to) may also be tagged with lifetimes so
///   that Rust can prevent them from being invalidated as well.
///
/// Inside a function, Rust doesn't let you explicitly name lifetimes. And each let
/// statement implicitly introduces a scope. However, once you cross the function
/// boundary, you need to start talking about lifetimes.
/// 
/// More info:
/// - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetimes.html#the-area-covered-by-a-lifetime>
/// - <https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/lifetime-mismatch.html>
