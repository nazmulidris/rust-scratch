# rust-scratch

This is a repo full of explorations into various Rust language features and crates. They
are written for didactic exposition where possible.

1. Articles on [developerlife.com](https://developerlife.com).
2. Videos on the
   [developerlife.com YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@developerlifecom?sub_confirmation=1).
3. Graduated into the [r3bl-open-core](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-open-core/) repo.
