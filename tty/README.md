## Prerequisite
<a id="markdown-prerequisite" name="prerequisite"></a>

Read all about TTY history and implementation in Linux
[here](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) before reading this repo and doing the
exercises here. There is so much background history and information in this article that is a
prerequisite to understanding anything in this repo. You can read them in this repo
[here](./tty_reading/The%20TTY%20demystified.html) (in case the site is not longer available). To
read them in this repo, run the following commands, and you will be able to access this web page on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
cd tty_reading
serve .
```
