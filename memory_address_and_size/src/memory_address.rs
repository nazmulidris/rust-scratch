//! # Different ways of getting a memory address, for a variable on the stack, in Rust.
//!
//! ## *const T (Immutable Raw Pointer)
//!
//! In the code below `as *const usize` converts the reference to a raw pointer of type
//! `*const usize`.
//! - That is, `*const T` represents a raw pointer to an immutable value of type `T`.
//! - You cannot modify the value that the pointer points to through a `*const T`.
//!   - The `const` marks that it is not possible to modify (the value) `T` using this raw
//!     pointer,
//!   - It is similar to a reference `&T`, which also provides read-only access to the
//!     value.
//!
//! ## *mut T (Mutable Raw Pointer)
//!
//! In the code below `as *mut usize` converts the reference to a raw pointer of type
//! `*mut usize`.
//!  - I.e., `*mut T` represents a raw pointer to a mutable value of type `T`.
//! - You can modify the value that the pointer points to through a `*mut T`.
//!   - It is similar to a mutable reference `&mut T`, which allows for read and write
//!     access to the value.
//!
//! ## std::ptr::addr_of!
//!
//! In the code below, the `std::ptr::addr_of!` macro is used to get the address of a
//! variable, instead of the `as *const usize` and `as *mut usize` syntax.
//!
//! ## std::ptr::addr_of_mut!
//!
//! In the code below, the `std::ptr::addr_of_mut!` macro is used to get the mutable
//! address of a variable, instead of the `as *mut usize` syntax.
//!
//! ## println!("{:p}", &val);
//!
//! In the code below, the `println!("{:p}", &val);` syntax is used to print the address
//! of a variable.
//!
//! # Different ways of getting a memory address, for a variable on the heap, in Rust.
//!
//! ## Vec::as_ptr
//!
//! In the code below, the `Vec::as_ptr` method is used to get the raw pointer to the
//! heap-allocated memory. Other ways to do this are to convert `Vec<T>` to `Box<[T]>` and
//! get the raw pointer to the heap-allocated memory.
//!
//! # Box::as_ref
//!
//! | Syntax        | Type      | Description                                                                |
//! |---------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `&my_box`     | `&Box<T>` | Use to get the addr of the `Box` itself, which is stack-allocated          |
//! | `Box::as_ref` | `&T`      | Use to get the addr of the value (inside the `Box`)) that's heap-allocated |
//!
//! Other ways to do this are to convert `Box<T>` to `&T` and get the raw pointer to the
//! heap-allocated memory using `Box::into_raw`.
